\chapter{Free energy calculations}
The preliminary metadynamics results from \cite{ourPaper} and summarized in section~\ref{sec:preliminaryMetadyn} of the charged ligand translocation across the membrane are made using the standard \martini \ac{FF} with a cut--off method for treating the electrostatic interactions. Unfortunately, as we have seen in chapter~\ref{chap:EmpiricalFF}, such method poorly describe the processes that involve the electrostatic interaction and hence it underestimates the energy barriers of the processes that involve the interaction between ions, water molecules and hydrophobic regions. Moreover the use of the standard \martini water model does not improve the energy barriers estimation.

The pathway to improve the model is the use of the \ac{PME} method to better describe the electrostatic interaction and the use of the \ac{PW} model to improve the behavior of the water solvent. For a comparison to be made, the idea, is to follow the procedure as in section~\ref{sec:preliminaryMetadyn} and, with metadynamics runs, try to estimate the energy barrier of the anchoring process with the use of the \ac{PME} alone and in combination with the \ac{PW} model. 

Preliminary, some tests about the use of the \ac{PME} method and the \ac{PW} model with a pure \ac{POPC} bilayer was performed. Then metadynamics runs for obtaining the \ac{FES} of the anchoring process involving both the striped (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) and the random (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) \acp{NP}, were performed with the use of the \ac{PME} alone and in combination with the \ac{PW} model. 
%In view of the results, then, as better described in the next chapter, unbiased \ac{MD} runs with the use of \ac{PME} and \ac{PW} involving all the \ac{NP} configurations were performed in order to investigate a possible change in the kinematic of the all the \ac{NP}--membrane interaction process.

\section{Metadynamics: system set--up and issues}
%tentativi di convergenza con bound
The idea for a comparison to be made on the basis of free energy calculations is to obtain the \ac{FES} of the anchoring process of one charged ligand as described in section~\ref{sec:preliminaryMetadyn} using the different \ac{NP} configurations with the new \martini models. Then, in order to understand if this more sophisticated \ac{CG} models is suitable to better describe such process a comparison with an atomistic simulation\footnote{All the atomistic simulations and metadynamics runs are performed by Federica Simonelli in her PhD study} is necessary. In this way we can investigate if a more realist description can be obtained with a \ac{CG} model in order to use it for future applications.

To summarize briefly, the process that I will consider for the \ac{FES} estimation of the ligand anchoring is composed of two steps: the first, called forward process: from the hydrophobic state to one anchor state; the second, backward process: from the anchored state to the hydrophobic state again. 

\paragraph{\textbf{system set--up}} In all of my \ac{MD} runs the membrane bilayer is made of $256$ \ac{POPC} lipids per leaflet. I will consider both the striped (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) and the random (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) \acp{NP}. The simulation box is neutralized with $30$ counteracting Na$^+$ ions and filled by water. In figure~(\ref{fig:startFrameEx}) is shown an example of the starting configuration for a striped (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) \ac{NP} in the hydrophobic state. The charged ligand for the anchoring process is choses so as to be the lowest ligand attached to the \ac{NP} core. The initial configuration frames with the \ac{PW} are obtained from the initial configuration frames with the standard \martini water using a python script that convert the standard \martini water to the \ac{PW} bead. With the \ac{PW} an equilibration run with the parameters shown in the third column of table~(\ref{tab:inputParam}) is necessary to correctly stabilize the system. For what concern the metadynamics input parameters, if not differently specified, they are summarized in table~(\ref{tab:metadynParam}).

The charged ligand chosen for the anchoring process is in cyan. The blue contour is the simulation box. Water beads and lipid tails are not shown.}
	\label{fig:startFrameEx}
\end{SCfigure}

\paragraph{\textbf{CV issues}} The \ac{CV} chosen to describe the anchoring process is the $z$ component of the distance between the center of the charged bead and the \ac{COM} of the bilayer. Although this \ac{CV} is a very intuitive and simple, with the introduction of the \ac{PME} method, and more accentuated with the \ac{PW} model, we found that it suffers from some issues. When I perform the metadynamics runs with the \ac{PME} and \ac{PW}, in accordance with the atomistic model, it is observed that the anchored state is more stable than with the standard \martini models: the increase of the model accuracy make the interaction between the negatively charged bead and the positively charged choline group of the lipid heads of the opposite leaflet, stronger than with the standard \martini. Hence, like in figure~(\ref{fig:engulfment}), we observe that when metadynamics try to dis--anchor the charged bead in the backward process, it pull back the lipid heads slightly deforming the opposite leaflet of the bilayer. This results in a worse estimation of the \ac{CV}.
\begin{SCfigure}[][h!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{./img/patchedEngulfment}
	\caption{Detail of the engulfment effect in the anchoring leaflet when the ligand tends to dis--anchor. Color code as in figure~(). Lipid tails are shown in cyan while the glycerol group is represented by the violet beads. Water and other lipid tails are not shown. The choline group (blue bead) is in contact with the charged bead of the ligand and the lipid tails are horizontal instead of vertical as they usually are.}
	\label{fig:engulfment}
\end{SCfigure}
Moreover, since the interaction with the lipid heads is stronger, the ligand tend to slightly pull down the \ac{NP} inside the bilayer.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./img/results/NPDistance/NPDist}
	\caption{Correlation between the \acs{CV} (red) and the $z$ component of the distance between the \acs{COM} of the \acs{NP} and the \acs{COM} of the bilayer (green) as a function of the simulation time. The region of the \acs{CV} space inside the dashed black lines is the overlapping region. Data obtained from a $6.5$~$\mu$s metadynamics run of a striped (\acs{MUS}:\acs{OT} $1$:$1$) \acs{NP} with \acs{PW}.}
	\label{fig:NPDist}
\end{figure}
From figure~(\ref{fig:NPDist}) we see that when the charged bead of the ligand (red) is approaching the water phase ($z>2$) of the opposite leaflet is not only due to the ligand itself but also because the \ac{COM} of the \ac{NP} tend to approach the \ac{COM} of the bilayer (green). Despite this can be an important molecular process in order for a comparison to be made, we must not sample the phase phase associated to the movement of the \ac{COM} of the \ac{NP} since we are interested in the \ac{FES} associated to the anchoring process only. An other import issue as the simulation time increase and related to the previous issues, is the loss of the ability by the \ac{CV} to well distinguish the two states, although the convergence has not yet reached. In figure~(\ref{fig:NPDist}) the red line is the \ac{CV}. In the region $z > 1$ the ligand have crossed the \ac{COM} of the bilayer and it is anchored in the opposite leaflet. For $z < -1$ the ligand is near the \ac{NP}'s leaflet in the hydrophobic state. While for $-1 < z < 1$ the ligand is in the hydrophobic region of the membrane but it may still be in contact with the head beads of the opposite leaflet. Hence inside the dashed black lines there is a region of the \ac{CV} space in which the two states are overlapping. As confirmed with my unbiased runs, this issue leads in a underestimation of the forward wall because tend to lower the saddle point when the metadynamics is sampling the anchored state.

% 	\label{fig:convTest}
% \end{figure}

\paragraph{\textbf{convergence problems}} An other issues related to this process is the achievement of the convergence, essential in the \ac{FES} estimation. Briefly, our metadynamics runs have not reached the convergence, even in tens of microseconds of simulation, as we can see from figure~(\ref{fig:NPDist}) (red lines) of a $6.5$~$\mu$s test run in which we try to reach the convergence. This is prevalently due to the just described issues associated to the \ac{CV}. But also, in accordance with my unbiased simulations and the atomistic results, because the energy barriers associated to the two metastable state are much higher than what are estimated in \cite{ourPaper}, slowing down the dynamics. 

\paragraph{\textbf{worse estimation of the FES}} From the previous description it is clear that following the procedure outlined in \cite{ourPaper} leads to a worse estimation of the \ac{FES} associated to the anchoring process. In particular this suggest a different pathway, at molecular level, for the forward process respect to the backward process and that some other \acp{CV} are missing. Using the same \ac{CV}, instead to try to estimate the whole \ac{FES}, we can try to estimate the energy wall associated to the forward process and, separately, the energy wall associated to the backward process. For the estimation of the energy wall of the forward process we need to start the metadynamics runs in the hydrophobic state and stop it when the ligand reach the anchored state. For the backward process we need to do the contrary: start the metadynamics from the anchored state and stop it when the ligand return to \ac{NP} leaflet.

\section{Forward process}
Since the preliminary task of my thesis work, I have performed ten metadynamics runs starting at hydrophobic state for each of the following ``configurations'': striped (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) with \ac{PME}; striped (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) with \ac{PME} and \ac{PW}; random (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) with \ac{PME} and \ac{PW}. This runs are suitable for the estimation of the forward energy wall.

For a comparison between different models to be made all the distance variables involving the bilayer (e.g. the chosen \ac{CV}) are scaled by the ratio between the thickness of a pure \ac{POPC} bilayer with the atomistic \ac{FF} and the one obtained with the \ac{CG} \ac{FF}. This ratio is calculated from the bilayer's thickness shown in table~(\ref{tab:POPCData}).
 
\subsection{Models comparison}
%striped models comparison (Standard, PME, PME & PW, Atomistico)
A comparison of the forward wall obtained for the striped (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) \ac{NP} with different models is shown in figure~(\ref{fig:forwardWall}). For the \ac{PME} and the \ac{PME}+\ac{PW} versions is shown an average over ten simulations each. For the STD version is shown an average over eight simulations. The atomistic version is obtained over an average of two simulations by Federica Simonelli. The error is estimate using the standard error as in the procedure described in section~\ref{sec:metadynamics}. As we can see, increasing the accuracy of the \ac{CG} model, in particular with the use of the \ac{PW} model, the \ac{CG} results are approaching the atomistic one. Despite the shift of the \ac{CV} respect to the thickness of a pure \ac{POPC} bilayer with the atomistic and the \ac{CG} models, we see that the minimum is not well align. This can be because in the metadynamics runs the thickness of the bilayer in the \ac{CG} models may change: for example, with the \ac{PW} and a striped \ac{NP} the thickness is in the range of $4$~nm to $4.4$~nm.

As we shall see later, the order of magnitude of the energy barrier is consistence with my unbiased simulations of all \acp{NP} with the \ac{PW} in which for ten of microseconds no anchor process is observed. This suggest that the energy wall is much higher than what is observed in \cite{ourPaper}. Another sign of the increasing of the energy wall as the \ac{CG} model accuracy increase, is the time spent by the \ac{NP} in the hydrophobic state. In table~(\ref{tab:hydroTime}) is shown a comparison of the average time spent by the \ac{NP} in the hydrophobic state between different models.

\subsection{Striped and random comparison}

The metadynamics runs performed allow us for a comparison of the forward energy wall for both striped (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) and random (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) \acp{NP} with the \ac{PW}. The comparison is shown in figure~(\ref{fig:forwardWallRP}). We can confirm the trend observed in \cite{ourPaper}: the striped (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) \ac{NP} has an higher energy wall for the hydrophobic to one anchor state transition than that for the random (\ac{MUS}:\ac{OT} $1$:$1$) \ac{NP}. Moreover in table~(\ref{tab:hydroTimeRP}) is show a comparison of the average time spent by the \ac{NP} in the hydrophobic state between the striped and the random configuration.

\section{Backward process: preliminary results}


\section{Discussion of the results}


% \paragraph{\textbf{ions translocation}} An important phenomenon mediated by the electrostatic interactions that is crucial for this thesis work is the lipid membrane ions translocation. In \cite{PW} the authors have computed the \ac{FES} of the translocation of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions\footnote{The \martini model for Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ associates the ion plus the hydration shell to a bead of type Qd positively charged and Qa negatively charged, respectively.} across a \acs{DPPC} membrane using umbrella sampling and the \ac{WHAM} with the standard \martini \ac{FF}, adding the \ac{PW} and adding together \ac{PW} and \ac{PME}. The height of the barriers are summarized in table~(\ref{tab:ionTranslocation}). The same \ac{FES} for a \acs{DMPC} membrane was calculated by Khavrutskii \etal\, \cite{atomisticTranslocation} with an atomistic \ac{FF}. Since the \martini model for the \acs{DPPC} lipid also model the \acs{DMPC} lipid a comparison can be made and it is shown in table~(\ref{tab:ionTranslocation}). As one can see, from left to right, increasing the loyalty of the treatment of the electrostatic interaction the \martini \ac{FF} approach the results of the atomistic \ac{FF}. Moreover in \cite{PW}, in accordance with the atomistic results in \cite{atomisticTranslocation}, for small cross membrane ions imbalance and only with the use of the \ac{PW} model and the \ac{PME} method, they observe some ion leakage without pore formation but still mediated by a water defect inside the membrane, called \textit{water finger} that help the ions to cross the hydrophobic region of the membrane. We remark that, these kind of phenomena, are totally absent using the standard \martini \ac{FF}. Hence, as already outlined, the importance to use a better treatment of the electrostatic interaction and a better model for water solvent.
